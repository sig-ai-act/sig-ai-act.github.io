## Objectives & Topics  

### Background  
As artificial intelligence and intelligent user interfaces (IUIs) reshape healthcare, new opportunities emerge to improve engagement, personalization, accessibility, and trust in health systems. Health IUIs must balance technological innovation with user needs, ethical considerations, and long-term care challenges across diverse populations, from patients managing chronic conditions to clinicians and caregivers.  

### Goals  
The HealthIUI 2026 Workshop aims to bring together an interdisciplinary community from HCI, AI, healthcare, psychology, and rehabilitation sciences to:  
- Explore innovative health IUIs that foster long-term engagement and personalization.  
- Address challenges of ethics, privacy, fairness, and inclusion in intelligent health technologies.  
- Share research findings, datasets, systems, and evaluation methods.  
- Build collaborations that advance human-centered, intelligent health technologies.  

### Topics of Interest include, but are not limited to:  
- Personalized Health Interfaces and Interventions  
- Adaptive Systems for Patient Engagement and Education  
- AI-driven Health Information Presentation and Recommender Systems  
- Multimodal and Conversational Interaction for Health & Care  
- Intelligent Interfaces for Chronic Disease Management  
- Assistive & Accessible IUIs for Older Adults or Populations with Limited Tech Access  
- Ethical, Privacy, and Trust Considerations in Health IUIs  
- Wearables and Sensor-based Health Interfaces  
- Rehabilitation and Cognitive Support Technologies  
- Equitable & Inclusive Design for Marginalized Populations  
- Longitudinal Studies and Real-world Evaluations of Health IUIs  
- Human-AI Collaboration in Clinical and Care Contexts
