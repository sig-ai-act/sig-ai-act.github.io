- Deliverables: checklists and decision support tools.

## Transparency & Documentation
- Translate transparency obligations into documentation patterns and model cards.
- Deliverables: templates, traceability specs, audit‑ready artifacts.

## Human Oversight
- Operationalize oversight requirements and escalation paths.
- Deliverables: oversight playbooks, HCI patterns, “stop button” design guides.

## Privacy & Data Governance
- Align data practices with GDPR/AI Act, including data lineage and consent.
- Deliverables: data governance checklists, DPIA aids, synthetic data guidance.

## Robustness & Evaluation
- Define test protocols and metrics for robustness, bias, and safety.
- Deliverables: evaluation frameworks, benchmark curation, references to tools.
