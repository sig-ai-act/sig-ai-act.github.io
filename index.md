## About SIG-TREQ

SIG-TREQ is a transdisciplinary initiative aimed at translating the principles of the EU AI Act—such as fairness, transparency, privacy, and robustness—into technical requirements and design practices for AI systems. The SIG is structured into modular subgroups dedicated to topics such as **risk classification**, **transparency**, **human oversight**, **privacy**, and **data governance**, working toward concrete outputs like **guidelines**, **evaluation methods**, and **tooling**.

Founded by researchers at **TU Delft**, SIG‑TREQ seeks to operationalize abstract legal and ethical principles through actionable, value‑driven specifications, targeting sensitive and high‑impact domains.

## Our Mission

To bridge the gap between legal obligations and technical practice in high‑risk AI development by building tools, frameworks, and design methodologies grounded in the EU AI Act.

### Objectives

1. Interpret and categorize regulatory language based on system type and risk levels.  
2. Translate legal principles into actionable technical specifications, reusable patterns, and best practices.  
3. Foster alignment across academia, industry, and regulators for trustworthy AI.

## What We Do

SIG‑TREQ operates as a modular, collaborative network involving academic researchers, practitioners, legal experts, policy experts, and industry partners. Core activities include:

- Working groups bringing together experts on **fairness**, **transparency**, **robustness**, and **privacy**.  
- Regular sessions, reading groups, and interdisciplinary workshops.  
- Case studies with institutions and industry partners (e.g., **healthcare**).  
- A **living technical specification** that evolves with legal and technological shifts.  
- **Evaluation frameworks** to measure values like fairness and transparency in practice.  
- **Governance tools** for developers, auditors, and regulators.  
- **Public consultations** to prototype and reflect real‑world needs.
